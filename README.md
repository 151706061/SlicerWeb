SlicerWeb
=========

Slicer modules that support web services and web applications.

*Note* this is still experimental and can't be used by normal people yet :)

Requires: cherrypy and PIL (see Experiments/slicr.sh for example installation
script).  Also requires python executable and distutils module in Slicer's python.
These are available in a local slicer superbuild, but must be added manually if
you are using a binary download of slicer from slicer.org.
